###############################
Welcome to IDB's documentation!
###############################

IDB is a `Python <http://python.org>`__ library package that
implements `Python Database API 2.0`-compliant support for the open source relational
database `InterBaseÂ® <https://www.embarcadero.com/products/interbase>`__.
In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API,
IDB also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database engine.

IDB is free -- covered by a permissive BSD-style `license
<license.html>`__ that both commercial and noncommercial users should
find agreeable.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on Python, SQL, or InterBase;
rather, it is a topical presentation of IDB's feature set,
with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns. For detailed
information about InterBase features, see the `InterBase documentation 
<https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/InterBase/2020/en/Main_Page>`.
